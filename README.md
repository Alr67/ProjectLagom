Unity game project for Android for the Computer Game KTHâ€™s course. The game consists in several minigames based on Swedish cultural facts and focused on the Lagom concept (Swedish word for not too much, not too little).
The users can not win or lose, but they have to get their scores the closest to what they consider it's "Lagom". This way, we can introduce funny facts about Swedish culture in a funny way or to make Swedish people see their own culture from a different point of view.
